## 💻 Method 3: Build Locally

**Best for**: Local development with full control

### Prerequisites:
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version recommended)
- Android Studio (or Android SDK)
- Java 17 or later

### Steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if not done already)
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd MyFlutter

# 2. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Build the APK
flutter build apk --release

# 4. Find your APK here:
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

**Verify Flutter is installed**:
```bash
flutter doctor
```
If this shows issues, fix them before building.

## 📦 Build Variants

You can build different types of APKs:

```bash
# Release APK (smallest, optimized - recommended)
flutter build apk --release

# Debug APK (larger, with debugging info)
flutter build apk --debug

# Split APKs by architecture (multiple smaller files)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

## 🎯 APK Location

After building, your APK will be at:
```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

The file size is approximately **17-20 MB** for release builds.

## 🚀 Summary

**Quickest**: Use GitHub Actions (Method 1) - no setup needed, just click and download

**Most Flexible**: Build locally (Method 3) - requires Flutter setup but gives you full control

**Good Middle Ground**: Use Codespaces (Method 2) - cloud environment with Flutter pre-installed
