## 📖 How to Use

### Configure Base Values
1. Open the app and tap the **Settings** icon (⚙️) in the app bar
2. Set metal rates for different gold purities and silver
3. Configure wastage percentages for gold and silver
4. Set making charges per gram for gold and silver
5. Tap **Save** to store your configuration

**Note**: Base values persist throughout the day and automatically reset to zero at midnight.

### Create an Estimate

#### Step 1: Enter Customer Information
- Expand the "Customer Information" section
- Fill in bill number, account number, customer name, address, and mobile number

#### Step 2: Calculate Item Details
1. **Select Type**: Choose from Gold 22K/916, 20K/833, 18K/750, or Silver
2. **Enter Weight**: Input the gross weight in grams
3. **Enter Wastage**: Wastage is auto-calculated based on settings (can be adjusted)
4. **Review Net Weight**: Automatically calculated (Weight + Wastage)

#### Step 3: Configure Making Charges
- Choose between "Rupees" or "Percentage" mode
- System applies minimum making charges (₹250 for gold, ₹200 for silver)
- Adjust manually if needed

#### Step 4: Apply Discount (Optional)
- Select discount type: None, Rupees, or Percentage
- Enter discount amount or percentage
- View amount after discount

#### Step 5: Review and Generate Invoice
- Review CGST and SGST (1.5% each)
- Check final amount including GST
- Tap **Download PDF** to generate and share invoice

## 🎯 Calculation Formula

```
Net Weight = Gross Weight + Wastage
J Amount = Net Weight × Rate per gram
Subtotal = J Amount + Making Charges
Amount After Discount = Subtotal - Discount
CGST = Amount After Discount × 1.5%
SGST = Amount After Discount × 1.5%
Total Amount = Amount After Discount + CGST + SGST
```

## 💾 Data Persistence

The application automatically saves your base values (metal rates, wastage percentages, and making charges) to local storage using SharedPreferences. This ensures that:

- **Your settings persist** across app restarts
- **Values are maintained** throughout the entire day
- **Automatic reset** occurs at midnight (based on system time)
- **No manual intervention** needed - the app handles everything automatically
